# React Fundamentals

## Folder Structure
- node_modules: Contains all dependencies required by the app. Main dependencies also listed in package.json
- public: Contains static assets including index.html (page template).
  - index.html
    - title
    - fonts
    - CSS
    - favicon
    - id="root" - Our entire app
- src: In simplest form it's the brain of our app. This is where we will do all of our work. src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
- .gitignore: Specifies which files source control (Git) should ignore.
- package.json: Every Node.js project has a package.json and it contains info about our project, for example list of dependencies and scripts.
- package-lock-json: A snapshot of the entire dependency tree.
- README: The markdown file where you can share more info about the project for example build instructions and summary.
- zoom: 175%

## Remove Boilerplate
- Remove src folder
- Create src folder
  - Create index.js inside src
- Toggle sidebar CTRL + B (VSCode)
- Shortcuts settings/keyboard shortcuts (VSCode settings icon -> Keyboard Shurtcuts CTRL + K CTRL + S)
